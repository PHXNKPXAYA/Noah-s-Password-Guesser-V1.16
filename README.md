# Noah's Password Guesser v1.1

**Noah's Password Guesser** is a powerful tool for generating password combinations based on user-inputted words. It uses permutations to create various password combinations, helping users generate potential password guesses based on commonly used words.

## Features in v1.1

- **Main Menu Navigation**: A new main menu allows users to easily navigate the program, including options to start the password generation, view help, or exit the application.
- **Help Menu**: A dedicated help section has been added to guide users on how to use the tool effectively.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Users can now go back to the main menu after completing the password generation process, ensuring smooth navigation throughout the application.
- **Search for Similar Passwords**: The tool uses difflib to help find similar passwords based on a user‚Äôs search query, making it easier to find potential matches.

## Installation

In order for the tool to work, you must first install the required dependency: **Colorama**. You can install it by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install colorama

2. Navigate through the **Main Menu** to choose between:
    - Starting password generation
    - Viewing help
    - Exiting the program
3. To start password generation:
    - Input up to 10 words (e.g., answers to security questions).
    - The program will generate permutations of these words to create possible passwords.
